## :book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python (ISLP), 2E

As a pure math student seeking an introduction into the foundations of machine learning, ISLP written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Rob Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor is regarded as one of the best entry points. Not only a quality textbook, but highly accessible! [Click to read for free](https://www.statlearning.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

The text covers mathematical and statistical theory of machine learning as well as applied labs in the programming language Python. 

Note: The text assumes a moderate level of mathematical maturity and features an earlier edition with labs written in the statistical language R.
